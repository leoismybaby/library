I needed this value to display it on the page, along with the new book title, author, and page numbers, after the user submits the form. I realized that I was trying to select the element by ID, however, I needed to select the element using an attribute selector ("input=[type=radio]") and use pseudo classes.

WHAT I HAVE LEARNED
Dialog and Modals (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) - I have learned about different subwindows and how to implement them in my project. 

Prevent Default (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) - I have learned to prevent the default action that normally occurs...

Setting and getting attributes (https://plainjs.com/javascript/attributes/setting-getting-and-removing-data-attributes-8/) - I had learned how to set and get attirubtes in a previous lesson. However, this is the first project where I have had to use this selector.

Classes - After completing the "classes" lesson from the Odin Project, I was instructed to implement classes into my code instead of using object constructors.
